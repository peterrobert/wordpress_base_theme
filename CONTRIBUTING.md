Thanks for contributing to `bootstrapwp` (Underscores) — you rock!

## bootstrapwp
Before getting started, make sure your issue has not been discussed earlier. You can search for existing tickets [here](https://github.com/Automattic/bootstrapwp/search).

Here are some tips to consider and to help you write a great report:

* `bootstrapwp` supports Internet Explorer 9 and greater, as well as the latest two versions of all other major browsers.
* `bootstrapwp` is backwards compatible with the two versions prior to the current stable version of WordPress.
* `bootstrapwp` uses HTML5 markup. In HTML5, it is common to use multiple `<h1>` elements.
* We decided to not include translations [[#50](https://github.com/Automattic/bootstrapwp/pull/50)] beyond the exisiting `bootstrapwp.pot` file, a RTL stylesheet [[#263](https://github.com/Automattic/bootstrapwp/pull/263)], or editor styles [[#225](https://github.com/Automattic/bootstrapwp/pull/225)], as they are likely to change during development of an `bootstrapwp`-based theme.
